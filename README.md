# Storytale

Storytale is a Gradle Plugin designed to help developers to show their composables and develop them isolated by generating a gallery of the project components.
Check the `examples` and their generated web gallery [here](https://kotlin.github.io/Storytale)

Since Storytale is still in the early stages of development, the api is marked as unstable, but this section will also show you how to use `Storytale` to write code for your components, so let's get started! üåü

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### 1. Setup

#### Import Dependencies

<details close>
  <summary>using <b>Version Catalog</b></summary>

> **libs.versions.toml**

```toml
[versions]
storytale = "0.0.1+dev3"

[plugins]
storytale = { id = "org.jetbrains.compose.storytale", version.ref = "storytale" }
```

> **build.gradle.kts** `root level`
```kotlin
plugins {
  alias(libs.plugins.storytale) apply false
}
```
</details>

> **build.gradle.kts** `app level`
```kotlin
plugins {
  alias(libs.plugins.storytale)
}
```
</details>

```kotlin
repositories {
  mavenCentral()
  maven("https://maven.pkg.jetbrains.space/public/p/compose/dev")
}
```

> [!NOTE]  
> Storytale **has not** yet released its first version on `mavenCentral`. Currently, we publish dev builds to maven("https://maven.pkg.jetbrains.space/public/p/compose/dev"), so it's required to add this repository as shown above.

### 2. Create Sourcesets for Storytale on the target platform (for multi-platform projects)

Storytale can be used for Compose Multiplatform projects. To start using the Storytale API, you need to define a sourceset for the component you want to test (for example, it might only be used for `Android/iOS` platforms, or it could be common for all platforms).

In your app's 'src' folder, go to New -> Directory:

### 3. Usage

Now, your project structure will look like this:

```
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ androidMain
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ commonMain
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ xxxxxStories/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ kotlin
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ desktopMain
```

Let's try to write a simple function in `commonMain`:

`commonMain/PrimaryButton.kt`
```kotlin
@Composable
fun PrimaryButton(onClick: () -> Unit, enabled: Boolean = true) {
  Button(onClick = onClick, enabled = enabled) {
    Text("Click me!")
  }
}
```

`commonStories/kotlin/PrimaryButton.story.kt`
```kotlin
import org.jetbrains.compose.storytale.story

val `PrimaryButton default state` by story {
   val enabled by parameter(true)
   PrimaryButton(onClick = {}, enabled = enabled)
}
```

Next, let's run the `desktopStoriesRun` command, you can find it in the `project/Storytale` section on the right side of the Gradle panel.

If you can't find all Gradle tasks containing `Storytale` after syncing, check if this option is enabled:

`settings->Experimental`

<img width="624" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eed99739-121e-49ce-82ad-2217676a5869">


## Building and Contributing

Once the sync is successful, run `./gradlew publishToMavenLocal`.

At this point, if you see these Storytale `Gradle tasks`, it means you‚Äôve successfully set up the project and can start contributing! :)

Before running `XXXXStoriesRun`, you need to run `./gradlew publishToMavenLocal` to deploy the latest changes if you've modified any part of the code (except for examples module)
